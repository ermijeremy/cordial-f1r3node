Penalty-aware Proof-of-Reputation state transitions.

This module models the state-changing boundary in `cordial-por`: callers may
submit only already-authorized equivocation events, validation is performed
against the complete previous snapshot, and a successor is exposed only after
validation and arithmetic preconditions have succeeded.  Correlation tiers
are computed exclusively from previous-round active reputation.
